# The Kronecker Product


**Author:** Ammon Hepworth

The Kronecker product is an operation on two matrices of arbitrary size resulting in a block matrix. It is a generalization of the outer product from vectors to matrices, and gives the matrix of the tensor product with respect to a standard choice of basis. The symbol for the Kronecker product is a circle with an x inscribed inside. It has existed since the 19th century [1]. It has some use in solving a type of problem called a Sylvester Equation, which follows the form AX+XB = C. Special cases of this equation arise in stability theory [2].  More recently the Kronecker product has found use in econometrics, the application of mathematical models to predict and study economies. It can be used to derive compact expressions of partial derivatives, which are needed to find the impact of changes in instrument and non-controlled variables [3].
