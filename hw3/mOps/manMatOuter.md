# Matrix Operations - Outer Product (special kronecker)

**Routine Name:** kronecker

**Author:** Ammon Hepworth


## Description

In linear algebra, an outer product is the tensor product of two vectors, a special case of the Kronecker product of matrices. [ref:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_product)

The outer product of two matrices, u and v, is a matrix, w, where w<sub>ij</sub> = u<sub>i</sub>\*v<sub>j</sub>

Thus, since this is simply a special case, we refer to our implementation of the kronecker product [here](https://ammonhepworth.github.io/MATH4610/hw3/mOps/manMatKronecker) where you will see an example of an outer product in the Example section
