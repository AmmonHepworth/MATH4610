# Machine Precision Writeup

In February of 1992, a US patriot missile malfunctioned in Saudi Arabia resulting in the deaths of 28 US soldiers. Army officials had reported loss of accuracy in these missile systems a few weeks earlier and had been working on a fix. Unfortunately for the soliders stationed where the tragedy occurred, the update would be too late. One day too late, in fact, as the software reached their division just a single day after the incident. The control computer in the missiles would gradually accumulate error over time with continued operation and when a critical point had been reached, the missile failed to target correctly and fell upon the friendly troops.
