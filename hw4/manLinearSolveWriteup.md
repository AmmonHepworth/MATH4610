# Linear Solver Test Sites

**Author:** Ammon Hepworth


## Description

1. https://sparse.tamu.edu  --- This website has a large collection of matrices that conveniently download into matlab files or will link to their matrixmarket page. It used to be a part of the University of Floridas matrix collection. It also has a nice interface and is modern, unlike the matrixmarket page.

2. https://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket --- This is one of the more comprehensive website for ready-made matrices. It has pretty awful UI though, and many of its matrices are too large or too specific to be useful to me as a student. It has good search filtering though, and you can filter specifically for linear solving matrices vs eigenvalue calculation ones or other things like that. Finding matrices that are small enough that I can use them is often a problem.
